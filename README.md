# retail-fake-data
bunch of modules to generate fake data required for a typical retail business.  All the data is generated using the faker library in python.

All the data generator modules are in seperate folder with an app.py that imports modules and updates field to create joins.

Sample data from an app.py run is available in the "data files" folder.
